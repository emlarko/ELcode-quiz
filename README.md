# Code Quiz

## Description 

The aim of this project was to create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz which runs in the browser.

## Usage 

When the 'Start Quiz' button is clicked, the user is presented with the first question and a 60 second timer starts. 

When an answer is selected, the app will tell the user if the answer is correct and move on to the next question. If the answer was correct, the user is awarded 10 points. If the answer was wrong, ten seconds is deducted from the timer. 

At the end of the quiz, the timer stops and the user is shown their score and is prompted to enter their initials. The quiz will also end if the timer reaches zero. 

When the user submits their initials with their high score, they are redirected to the high score page. They have the option to go back to the quiz, and to clear the high scores.
